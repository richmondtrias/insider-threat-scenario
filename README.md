# Threat Hunt Report: Insider Threat
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/richmondtrias/insider-threat-scenario/blob/main/insider_threat_exfil_sensitve_data_template.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Microsoft Outlook

##  Scenario

Management suspects that an employee may be exfiltrating PII data via email. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of the employee being disgruntled after performance evaluation. The goal is to detect any files or folders that have been created and/or moved and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks. If any data is found, notify management.

### High-Level Insider Threat IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `PII` file events.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of Microsoft Outlook usage.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` Table

Searched for any file that had the string "PII" in it and discovered what looks like the user "employee" created a PII file in Notepad, moved the file into a folder called PII on the desktop, and then created a zip file called `PII.zip` in the Windows Temp folder at `2025-03-25T10:41:03`. These events began at `2025-03-25T10:32:22`.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName startswith target_machine
| where FileName contains "PII"
| where ActionType in ("FileCreated", "FileRenamed")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
| order by Timestamp desc
```

">

### 2. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Searched for any `ProcessCommandLine` that contained the string "olk.exe". Based on the logs returned, at `2025-03-25T05:48:35`, an employee on the "training-vm-118" device ran `olk.exe` which is Microsoft Outlook outside operation hours of the company. Between `2025-03-25T10:34:32` and `2025-03-25T10:37:09` multiple Outlook processes are created possibly signaling preparation for exfiltration. At `2025-03-25T18:40:54` the `olk.exe` process is created again afterhours.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == target_machine
| where FileName == "olk.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
```
